                    I enjoy using the techniques learned in the GA Tech Full Stack bootcamp to create beautiful web pages. I was excited to know
                    that this class was offered which would give me the opportunity to dive right in and get started on a
                    new career path.
                </p>
                <p>I enjoy the diversity of languages. I have learned and spoken French and Bengali with family and friends.
                    I had the opportunity to live in and travel with my family to differenct parts of the USA and other countries.
                </p>
                <p> My husband and I have a son and daughter, both in middle school and a small white and black dog, named Oreo.
                    I also enjoy reading and working in the garden.
